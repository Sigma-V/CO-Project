# We have implemneted an custom build assembler using the ISA sheet given to us. We have implemented all the cases and possible ourpurs in the code. ALl the outputs have been verified as per the given sheet. The Assembler reads the input Txt file from a text file " Instructions.txt". Then iterates over the given input to find all the possible errors and print them accordingly. Finally, if the given input is correct, it gives us the binary encoding of the same.
